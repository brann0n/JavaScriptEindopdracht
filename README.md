# JavaScriptEindopdracht
Dit is de repository voor de Javascript Eindopdracht van NHL Stenden.
Voor dit vak heb ik de game "UNO Anywhere" gemaakt, een online versie van het redelijk bekende kaart spel.
Vanaf hier zal alles in het Engels zijn.

## How to install
To install and use the game yourself you have 2 options: 
* Clone the repo into visual studio and run it within IISExpress
* Download and exract the game release and run it under IIS on a windows server.

The game itself requires .net 4.7.2 and doesn't need any other setting up.\
Running under IISExpress is going to solve most problems and will let you start playing on localhost right away.\
Running under IIS allows you to point a DNS name to it and play with your local network or even the public internet.

To make things easy, I have done this for you.\
Take a look at http://uno-anywhere.ga \
*Since this is a public server, and I don't know how many people will want to play, lobby names may contain explicit language.*

## How to play
To play this game you need atleast 3 devices: 
* 1 sharable screen (this can be a spare phone, a laptop or even a TV with internet)
* 2 private screens (this can be your phone, or your laptop, as long as other players cannot see it)

To learn about how the game works you can check out the game's landing page: http://uno-anywhere.ga 
From there you will find a link to http://game.uno-anywhere.ga this is the game lobby, from here you can create or join games.
Before playing please make sure you are familiar with the rules that were implemented into this version of UNO.\
You can find the rules here: http://game.uno-anywhere.ga/Session/Rules
